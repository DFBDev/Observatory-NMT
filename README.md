# Observatory (Network Monitoring Tool)

Observatory is a modern alternative to traditional network monitoring tools (NMTs), designed for individuals who value simplicity without compromising on capability.

While many NMTs are overly complex and intimidating, this alternative streamlines the monitoring process while equipping users with an extensive suite of tools and utilities to analyze, track, and manage their network effortlessly; complemented by a simple yet effective user interface.
